 * Model specifications-
    
    * Arduino MEGA 2560 is used as the controlling unit here
    * One 20x4 LCD display along with push switches are used to make the interface interactive
    * Magnetic NO switches are placed before each signal to determine the location of the train
    * Three coloured signals (Green, Yellow, Red) are used here
    * Two SPDT relays are used to reverse the direction of current in OHE for backward movement of the train. One more SPDT relay is used to start or stop the OHE supply
    * All the 6 interrupts of Arduino MEGA are used in this code
